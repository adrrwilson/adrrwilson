Hi, my name is Adrian! I am a software engineer with 2 years of professional experience, primarily working with Ruby and using Linux and VSCode to develop.
In my free time I enjoy solving problems with code, such as those found on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net.).
I am an avid dancer, having performed with an internationally touring salsa team, Salsa Caliente, at events such as the New York Salsa Congress and the Congreso Mundial de la Salsa in Puerto Rico. 
My hobbies include kitesurfing, hiking, reading and playing musical instruments such as guitar, bass, drums, piano, vocals, and saxophone.
