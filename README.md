Hi, my name is Adrian! I am a software engineer with 2 years of professional experience, primarily working with Ruby and using Linux and VSCode to develop.
In my free time I enjoy solving problems with code, such as those found on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net.).
My hobbies include dancing, kitesurfing, hiking, reading and playing guitar.
